### Migration Guide

#### From 0.4.x to 0.5.0
- **New API**: Use the unified pipeline for automatic algorithm selection:
  ```rust
  // Old way (still supported)
  let mesh = some_specific_algorithm(&point_cloud)?;

  // New way (recommended)
  let mesh = auto_reconstruct(&point_cloud)?;
  let result = ReconstructionPipeline::default().reconstruct(&point_cloud)?;
  ```

- **Enhanced Configuration**: Take advantage of new quality and use case presets:
  ```rust
  let mesh = auto_reconstruct_with_quality(&point_cloud, QualityLevel::HighQuality)?;
  let mesh = auto_reconstruct_for_use_case(&point_cloud, UseCase::Engineering)?;
  ```

- **Parallel Processing**: Optionally configure thread pools for optimal performance:
  ```rust
  use threecrate_reconstruction::parallel::{init_thread_pool, ThreadPoolConfig};

  let config = ThreadPoolConfig::default().with_threads(8);
  init_thread_pool(config)?;
  ```

### Breaking Changes
- Minimum Rust version requirement may have increased due to new dependencies
- Some internal APIs have changed (public API remains backward compatible)
